title: Technologies Used
---

In this project, we have used th following technologies:

## Ansible

This powerful automation tool allows us to easily deploy our project on remote server.

It is a must have for it's ease of use and efficiency !

## Jenkins

Jenkins is an automation server that used to run 'jobs' (a set of tasks).

In the project, for exemple, Jenkins is used to automatically fetch latests releases from diferent git repositories.

### JCasc (Jenkins Configuration as Code)

JCasC is a Jenkins plugin we use to predefine the configuration of our Jenkins server.

This way, it is really easy to set up a new the project on a new server !

## Docker

This platform allows us to run our application in isolation.

By using Docker containers, we ensure that our application runs consistently across different environments.

## Digital Ocean

This is the cloud service provider we used to host all our machines.

We have choosen it because we had 200$ of free credits thanks to our scholarship !
