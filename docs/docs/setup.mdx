# Setup

This guide will help you set up your development environment for the project. Follow the steps below to get started.

## Prerequisites

Have an account on Digital Ocean with enough credits to create a droplet & a kubernetes cluster.

## Step 1: Setup the droplet

On the dashboard, under the create menu, select Droplets.

1. Choose a region close to you for the server location.
2. Choose a basic droplet with ubuntu.
3. Choose a regular plan with at least 2GB of RAM & 50ish GB of disk space.
4. Choose between ssh keys or a password for authentication.
5. Set jenkins as the hostname.
6. Check that it is linked to a project, the same one we will use to setup kubernetes on.
7. Click create droplet.

## Step 2: Setup the kubernetes cluster

On the dashboard, under the create menu, select Kubernetes.

1. Choose a region close to you for the server location.
2. Choose a basic cluster with at least 2 nodes, each with 2GB of RAM & 50ish GB of disk space.
3. Set the version to the latest stable one.
4. Set the cluster name to whanos-cluster.
5. Check that it is linked to a project, the same one we used to setup the droplet.
6. Click create cluster.

## Step 3: Create sudoer user on the droplet

1. SSH into the droplet using the IP address provided by digital ocean as root.
2. Create a new user with the **command**: `adduser jenkins`
3. Add the user to the sudo group with the command: `usermod -aG sudo jenkins`
4. Add your public ssh key to `/home/jenkins/.ssh/authorized_keys` file.
5. Change the ownership of the newly created directory to jenkins with the command: `chown -R jenkins:jenkins /home/jenkins`
6. Logout and try to login as jenkins to verify everything is working.

From now, every step happening on the droplet will be done as the jenkins user for more safety.
