# Setup

This guide will help you set up your development environment for the project. Follow the steps below to get started.

## Prerequisites

Have an account on Digital Ocean with enough credits to create a droplet & a kubernetes cluster.

## Step 1: Setup the droplet

On the dashboard, under the create menu, select Droplets.

1. Choose a region close to you for the server location.
2. Choose a basic droplet with ubuntu.
3. Choose a regular plan with at least 2GB of RAM & 50ish GB of disk space.
4. Choose between ssh keys or a password for authentication.
5. Set jenkins as the hostname.
6. Check that it is linked to a project, the same one we will use to setup kubernetes on.
7. Click create droplet.

## Step 2: Setup the kubernetes cluster

On the dashboard, under the create menu, select Kubernetes.

1. Choose a region close to you for the server location.
2. Choose a basic cluster with at least 2 nodes, each with 2GB of RAM & 50ish GB of disk space.
3. Set the version to the latest stable one.
4. Set the cluster name to whanos-cluster.
5. Check that it is linked to a project, the same one we used to setup the droplet.
6. Click create cluster.

## Step 3: Setup the docker registry

On the left menu of the website, under the manage section, select Container Registry & then create.

1. Select your prefered subscription plan, the free one can only contain a couple of images, you may want to take the basic plan to have enough space
2. Try to take a region close to your droplets for better performance.
3. Give it a clear name (you can't change it later !), like whanos-docker-registry.
4. Once created, go to the settings tab of the registry and select edit for the DigitalOcean Kubernetes integration.
5. Select the cluster you created earlier and it should be done in a few seconds.

## Step 4: Create sudoer user on the droplet

1. SSH into the droplet using the IP address provided by digital ocean as root.
2. Create a new user with the **command**: `adduser jenkins`
3. Add the user to the sudo group with the command: `usermod -aG sudo jenkins`
4. Add your public ssh key to `/home/jenkins/.ssh/authorized_keys` file.
5. Change the ownership of the newly created directory to jenkins with the command: `chown -R jenkins:jenkins /home/jenkins`
6. Logout and try to login as jenkins to verify everything is working.

From now, every step happening on the droplet will be done as the jenkins user for more safety.
